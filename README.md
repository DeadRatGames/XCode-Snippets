Better XCode Snippets
=====================

#### A set of snippet files that **overwrite the default XCode snippets**, now snippets are useful at last!

  The shortcut for most snippets is  `snip-`  so that's all you need to remember.
  
  The new set includes some really useful new bits of code, and you can even further edit them. (see below).
 
- **Skeleton functions** make programmatically creating Views and Buttons a snap  
- **Autocomplete helpers** that correct commonly mis-spelled and lengthy constants.
- **LLDB Commands** you can drag right into the LLDB debugger, like recursiveDescription. Yes, that's _very_ cool
- **Reference Links** to useful online resources like the Standard iOS fonts website.
- Some useful **git commands** are stored as a snippet. Like "How do I undo that last remote push???"
- Removed the original annoying autocompletes that used to interfere with code completion, of course.
  

Installation
============

 Simple!
 
  Copy all the individual *.snippet* files to your XCode user snippet directory located at:
  
   `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/`
   
   

###### These snippets only overwrite XCode's default snippets, all your custom snippets are perfectly safe.

If you actually _like_ any of the stock snippets, you will need to find which .snippet file overwrote the original or just delete all the snippets.

### Editing these new Snippets

You **CAN** change the _*Title*_, _*Shortcut*_ or _*Summary*_. Go nuts.

You **CANNOT** change the _*Platform*_, _*Language*_ or _*Completion Scope*_.
Well, actually you could but if you do the original snippet that was overwritten __shall return__ in all it's immutable and indestructable glory.

Of course you can add new snippets too.

### Backing Up Your Snippets

  Just go copy all your snippets from this directory:
  
     `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/`

 Save them somewhere safe or copy them to a new machine.
